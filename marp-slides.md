# Ergonomic Layouts

## But first, some history...

<!--
How did we get here?


---

- In the 1860's C. L. Sholes made the first commercial typewriter in a Milwaukee, using U.S. English.

- Early prototypes used alphabetically ordered keys. But they were difficult to type with (since our fingers don't read left to right).

- **Fun fact**: Some had only capitol letters and numbers 2-9.
  It was suggested to use letters o and l for 0 and 1.

- After 5-10 years of iterations, QWERTY was born.

---

- QWERTY was designed to keep common letter pairs apart to prevent jamming.

- Contrary to mythology, it was not specifically designed to slow typers down.

- Bigram spread was actually a good way to allow for fast typing since it alternates the work between hands. But we can do better now with more data driven approaches.

- QWERTY has remained the de facto standard ever since the first typewriter. Most variations make minimal changes to it, even when not using English.

### French (AZERTY)

Other Latin character languages build off qwerty. Sometimes with small variations.
-->

---

![bg fit](./media/Greek_keyboard_mono_3b.png)

<!--

### Greek

Even in languages with different characters they build off qwerty.

# Alternative layouts

---

![bg fit](./media/dvorakkb.png)

<!--
This is the first well know alternative layout. Created 1936.

August Dvorak studied letter frequencies and the physiology of the hand.

Common letters should be in the home row.

Notice vowels on the left hand and special characters rearranged.

## Ergonomics

### Takeaways


* High effort (months), high return: Alternate layouts

* Low effort (1 week), medium return: Thumb clusters!

---

## Ergonomics

### FAQ

<!--
These are questions I regularly get when people see my keyboard.
-->

---

### I already type 100 WPM. Do these optimizations really make you faster?

<br />

* ## __Its all about comfort__

<!--
Its all about comfort
Speed could also happen...
-->

---

### Can you still type on other peoples keyboards?

<br />

* ## __Yes__

<!--
Sure.
I use QWERTY on my laptop and phone every day
-->

---

### What's the best layout?

<br />

* ## __It depends__

<!--
It depends on what you are doing. english? spanish? programming?
-->

---

### I don't have time to learn another layout. Is there something quick and easy that I can do instead?

<br />

* ## __Thumb clusters!__

<!--
Thumb clusters! Biggest bang for your buck.
Your pinkies will thank you.
-->

---

### Seems like a waste of money

* ### __You press thousands of keys a day__

<!--
More people spend more and more time at a computer every day.

The average office worker presses 2-10k keys per day. Thats millions a year.

You probably spend 5+ hours a day at a keyboard. Why use a piece of junk?

Unless you have a deprivation mind set. Then go for it.

# Key takeaways

* Thumb clusters are awesome.

* QWERTY is an outdated convention.

* Keyboard customization is a (fun) rabbit hole.
